            id: 4,
            question: "What does an AML/CFT compliance engagement look like?",
            answer: "A typical AML/CFT engagement starts with a compliance gap analysis of your current framework. I then develop or refine your AML/CFT policies, assist with regulatory reporting (SAR/STR), prepare for regulatory audits, and deliver a remediation roadmap. Engagements are project-based, usually lasting 2–12 weeks depending on scope and complexity.",

            answer: "I design and implement your KYC/CDD framework from scratch or optimize an existing one. This includes Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for PEPs and high-risk clients, sanctions and watchlist screening optimization, transaction monitoring rule tuning to reduce false positives, and risk scoring methodology development. Typical duration is 4–8 weeks.",

            question: "How is pricing structured?",
            answer: "Pricing depends on the service and scope. I offer three models: Custom (project-based, scoped to your specific needs), Fixed (set price for defined deliverables like training programs), and Retainer (ongoing monthly advisory or QA services). I provide a detailed proposal with transparent pricing after the initial consultation.",
